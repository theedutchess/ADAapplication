##Overview
As a touring musician for 15 years (including The Dutchess & the Duke, Universe People, The Fall-Outs, Unnatural Helpers and The Intelligence), I've made a living performing music, caring for children, and working multiple bartending jobs.<p>I'm ready to make a change.  Through my volunteer work I've discovered a passion for learning and service.  It's time to become technically savvy and apply new skills to make a greater impact on the world, while simultaneously building a new career.<p>Becoming a coder is the best way to support myself not just financially, but to reach a broader audience and share resources that help other women and the community at large.

##Experience
####Co-founder/Activist, [#ShoutYourAbortion](https://twitter.com/ShoutYrAbortion)<p>September 2015-present
In partnership with Amelia Bonow and Lindy West, we started a conversation that is changing the narrative about abortion in the United States and beyond.  It began as an idea to create a "zine of personal stories sharing women's positive experiences with abortion, reducing stigma about a legal medical procedure one in three women will experience in their lifetimes.  The #ShoutYourAbortion hashtag went viral overnight.  The #SYA story quickly outgrew Twitter and was reported worldwide, including the front page of The New York Times, a segment on Nightline, and hundreds of global media outlets <p><ul><li>Organizer of gatherings, counter-protests, and t-shirt/button-making parties<li>Admin of original Shout Your Abortion Facebook page, now admin of private regional group pages<li>Media representative, handling written and in-person interviews</ul>
